*All the detail in file "Sale Analysis Report.pdf"*
### ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT GOAL:
***Overall assessment of the company's business*** based on business questions

### ðŸ‘‰ KEY FINDING:
- The company's Ecommerce channel is not performing well.
- All 3 sales channels have had a sharp decrease in conversion rates (December 26, 2019 - January 25, 2020), so it can be concluded that the company's product line is facing a crisis.
- Store has the highest conversion rate. On average, 27% of customers who visit the store will make a purchase.
### ðŸ“Š STRATEGIC SUGGESTION:
#### Suggestion 1: Focus more on E-commerce: 
The company is not doing well in finding new customers. Customers know about the company mainly through the website. The company needs to more e-commerce channels because this is a potential channel to expand the customer base
#### Sugestion 2: Multi-channel communication:  
Communication activities are doing well when attracting more than 600 old customers to re-purchases every day. But the number of customers is concentrated on the website channel, the company should launch communication activities in 2 remaining channels to increase the attraction.
